# Dokku admin scripts

> Some handmade useful scripts for those admins out there. Because life is hard enough.

Read every script *BEFORE* you run them.

## Scripts

* *create_swap_file.bash :* Creates a swap file and adds it to fstab. When you need more memory, "Right now!"

* *reconfigure_cloned_server.bash :* Personally I always clone a master Dokku server, so I need to change variables, URLs, etc.

* *setup_wordpress.bash :* Easy script to deploy a Wordpress app, creating MariaSQL databases, etc.
